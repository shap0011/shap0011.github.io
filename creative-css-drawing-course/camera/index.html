            <p>My chosen line of work is Web Development.I love web developing in general, and especially coding. I love
                to work with clients and help them realize their ideas into a real and working project. Also, I would
                like to help the client to renew or rebrand their website, improve usability and accessibility, fix code
                issues for better performance and faster speed. My latest interest is creating images and animation with
                CSS code. I believe that it is a good alternative to website images in .jpg and .pdf format, or .svg
                images and animations. The images which created with HTML/CSS code are reusable, easy to resize, change
                shape and colors, no need to use the very expensive Adobe Suites Applications. I could develop for my
                client website HTML/CSS custom images and animations and turn sketches and graphics into CSS graphics
                with code.</p>
