        <p>I am Olga and I am an Algonquin College student. The program I am a student in is Interactive Media Design. I
            chose this program because I like creating digital visual content for websites and writing code to add
            interactivity to them. I believe, it makes websites attractive and entertaining to visitors. Website
            visitors should not only be just "readers", they must be active users as well because any website is "a
            door" into a company's business and it should benefit users if this is a government website or, it must be
            profitable if it belongs to a commercial enterprise.</p>
        <!-- Add a motivation quote that you like with proper citation. If it is in your own words credit yourself. -->
        <blockquote>The way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing. <cite>Walt Disney</cite></blockquote>
        <p>The words are true not only for individuals, for social and for commerce processes, and the environment
            should be active as well. As a web developer, I understand the website must be not only attractive but
            encourage visitors to take action.</p>
