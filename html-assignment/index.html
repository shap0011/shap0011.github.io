        <p>I am Olga and I am an Algonquin College student. The program I am a student in is <abbr
                title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr>. I chose this program because I like creating digital visual
            content for websites and writing code to add interactivity to them. I believe, it makes websites
            <em>attractive and entertaining</em> to visitors.</p>
        <p>Website visitors should not only be just "readers", they must be active users as well because any website is
            "a door" into a company's business and it should benefit users if this is a government website<sup>[1]</sup>
            or, it must be profitable if it belongs to a commercial enterprise.</p>
        <!-- Add a motivation quote that you like with proper citation. If it is in your own words credit yourself. -->
        <blockquote>The way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing. <cite>Walt Disney</cite></blockquote>
        <p> These words are true not only for individuals, but also for social and commerce processes, and the
            environment should be active as well. As a web developer, I understand the website must not only be
            attractive but encourage visitors to take action.</p>
